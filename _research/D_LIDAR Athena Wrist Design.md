## Introduction
LIDAR focuses on co-bot robotics, functioning similarly to Boston Dynamics. Several projects study locomotion and manipulation on the MIT Cheetah, Cassie Biped, and Athena. Athena was designed by LIDAR as an upper half of Cassie.

In a small team of two, I designed a differential 3 DOF wrist to be implemented into a larger torso robot. The wrist needed to be agile and light weight, as well as rigid enough to withstand up to 7 N-lb of torque.

## Takeaway
Manufacturing processes such as carbon fiber molds, sheet metal water jetting, and welding will be used to manufacture the robot. Through this project, I've learned about robotic design, inverse dynamics and kinematics, URDF generation, and MATLAB simulation. This project also laid the foundation for my strong background in SOLIDWORKS.
