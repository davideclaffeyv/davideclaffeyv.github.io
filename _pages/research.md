I've contributed to research in AIM (Artificial Intelligent Manufacturing) at Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility, Human Augmentation with AI at DART Labs Hip Exoskeleton project, Dextrous Co-bots at LIDAR Athena, and Aerospace Vehicle Design at Design Build Fly.

Currently my primary involvement is with the BeamTeam at the AMPF, working on novel backpropagation algorithms for tomography systems.
