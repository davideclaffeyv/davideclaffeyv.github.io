## [Formlabs Product Development Intern]()

**Janurary 2023-August 2023**

Formlabs is the leading SLA (stereolithography) 3D printer manufacturer in the world. I interned on the Print Process team for 8 months, a team at the center of materials, software, and mechanical testing. Print Process develops algorithms for systematic testing of next gen printers, and runs very high pace experimentation sprints before passing off polished procedures or documents to material operational teams, software, or hardware. I worked on optics, material science, polymerization dynamics, thermal fluids, and computer vision projects!

## [AI Manufacturing Researcher]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/AMPF%20Computer%20Vision%20and%20Additive%20Argon%20Flow/)

**August 2022 - Current**

In the Delta Airlines Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility with the BeamTeam, I work on using computer vision and fluid mechanics to characterize the flow of argon to the Directed Energy Deposition additive metal nozzle. The purpose of the project is to standardize argon flow rate for varying materials (Molybdenum, Tantalum, Aluminum, etc) for consistent weld-pool mass delivery.

## [CNC Master/Prototyping Instructor]({{ site.baseurl }}/CNC/cnc)

**May 2021 - Current**

At Flowers Invention Studio, the largest student-run makerspace in the US, I volunteer as a prototyping instructor and CNC master. As an instructor, I am trained on a wide variety of manufacturing techniques: 3D Printing with Resin, FDM, and Carbon fiber, laser cutting, water jetting, woodworking, electronics/soldering, sewing, vinyl, metal work, and CNC. Additionally, I am metal CNC master, a further distinction showing a studied manufacturing focus on the manual mill, Tormach 3-Axis, Emco 3-Axis, and Pocket NC 5-Axis. As CNC master, I am responsible for the machining area maintenance, training, and research projects.

## [BioKinematics ML Researcher]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/DART/)

**August 2021 - Current**

At DART and EPIC labs, I've completed several projects relating to the lab's hip exoskeleton as part of human-dodging augmentation research. I developed a pipeline for torque curve generation using large kinematic data sets, OpenSim, Vicon, and Matlab. I've also created pipelines for analyzing this data, as well as using XGBoost to classify and predict motion primitives base on movement segmentation and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) Data.

## Engineering Intern At Tosoh

**May 2021-August 2021**

Tosoh manufactures sputtering targets, the consumable high-purity metal plates used by chip manufacturers to create microelectronic gates using magnetrons (Vacuum tubes) to induce high-energy surface plasma depositions. At Tosoh, I worked with the Facilities, CNC, Robotics, and CAD directors to create PM Schedules, analyze high-voltage data, produce FEA analysis on press tooling, and optimize the process engineering on the factory floor.

## [Software Developor](https://www.drclaffey.com/)

**May 2020-August 2021**

At Grove City Endodontics, I developed both front end and back end software for confidential patient information logging and insurance validation. I used SQL in conjunction with python and the local office network to create an office logging and query system for the front desk. I also developed the office's website and helped implement an AI assistance with DocAI.
