## [Tormach Software Engineering Intern](https://tormach.com/)

**June 2024-August 2024**

Tormach is actively creating products that bring manufacturing and automation to users of all disciplines, providing means of high-quality machines while reducing learning curves with intelligent and intuitive software. Tormach's machines are used from educational environments to cutting edge aerospace manufacturers.

At Tormach, I worked on front-end, back-end, and embedded level software supporting PathPilot software for the CNC machines as well as the 6-DOF industrial arm. While taking on bugs and features, I also worked on development of future automation ecosystems, developing communication techniques for the mill and robotics within an automation cell. I expanded my knowledge of containerization with Docker, signal processing and application design with ROS, embedded stack design with HAL, and GDK and QT UI design in both Python2 and 3.

## [Formlabs Product Development Intern](https://formlabs.com/company/)

**Janurary 2023-August 2023**

Formlabs is the leading SLA (stereolithography) 3D printer manufacturer in the world. I interned on the Print Process team for 8 months, a group at the center of materials, software, and mechanical testing.

Print Process wears many hats in new product development. The team is one of the first beta-testers of pre and post production prototypes. Print process develops testing procedures, fast-print parameters, new features, and experimental resins to pass onto the operations testing, mechanical engineering, software development, and materials design teams.

I worked on projects that increased the reliability of prints, explored wiper dynamics in reactive resins, tested optical stacks, optimized resin chemistries, combatted polymer shrinkage, detected force regimes during print, and used high-speed computer vision during the peak of Form4 development!

**August 2022 - Current**

In the Delta Airlines Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility with the BeamTeam, I worked on using computer vision and fluid mechanics to characterize the flow of argon to the Directed Energy Deposition additive metal nozzle. The purpose of the project is to standardize argon flow rate for varying materials (Molybdenum, Tantalum, Aluminum, etc) for consistent weld-pool mass delivery. The final product used OTS MEMS sensors and stepper motors to control the flow valves. I gained experience in mechatronic design, PID tuning, and sensor serial communication protocols.

Now, I work on novel algorithms for magnetic scanning of internal features of additively manufactured parts.

## [CNC Master/Prototyping Instructor]({{ site.baseurl }}/CNC/cnc)

**May 2021 - Current**

At Flowers Invention Studio, the largest student-run makerspace in the US, I volunteer as a prototyping instructor and CNC master. As an instructor,

I am trained on a wide variety of manufacturing techniques: 3D Printing with Resin, FDM, and Carbon fiber, laser cutting, water jetting, woodworking, electronics/soldering, sewing, vinyl, metal work, and CNC.

Additionally, I am metal CNC master, a further distinction showing a studied manufacturing focus on the manual mill, Tormach 3-Axis, Emco 3-Axis, and Pocket NC 5-Axis. As CNC master, I am responsible for the machining area maintenance, training, and research projects.

## [BioKinematics ML Researcher]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/DART/)

**August 2021 - Current**

At DART and EPIC labs, I completed several projects relating to the lab's hip exoskeleton as part of human-dodging augmentation research. I developed a pipeline for torque curve generation using large kinematic data sets, OpenSim, Vicon, and Matlab.

I also used XGBoost to classify and predict motion primitives base on movement segmentation and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) Data. These motion primitive models would output which way and at what speed the user was believed to be moving based on three IMUs. I also designed dynamic motor covers to improve the ergonomics of the exo, and participated in several studies.

## [Engineering Intern At Tosoh](https://www.tosohamerica.com/)

**May 2021-August 2021**

Tosoh manufactures sputtering targets, the consumable high-purity metal plates used by chip manufacturers to create IC chip architectures via sputtering - a thin film deposition technique.

At Tosoh, I worked with the Facilities, CNC, Robotics, and CAD directors to create PM Schedules, analyze high-voltage data, produce FEA analysis on high-force cold-forge tooling, and optimize the machine cell layout for process engineering.

## [Software Developor](https://www.drclaffey.com/)

**May 2020-August 2021**

At Grove City Endodontics, I developed both front end and back end software for confidential patient information logging and insurance validation. I used SQL, Tkinter, and python to create an office logging and query system for the front desk.

I also designed the office's website and helped implement an AI assistant with DocAI.
