### Hello

I'm David Claffey, a maker, engineer, and student at Georgia Tech. I currently study Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science Intelligence, and will be pursuing a masters in Computing Intelligence in 2025. I conduct research with several labs and engage in personal projects exploring controls, machine learning / autonomy, metallurgical / polymer additive manufacturing, and applied physics. I'm a volunteer as a [CNC]({{ site.baseurl }}/CNC/cnc) master and Prototyping Instructor at [Flowers Invention Studio](https://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/), maintaining several high-end CNC machines, managing tool wear and budget, and designing curricula for trainings.

Check out the various pages linked at the top to read more about my personal projects, research experience, and work terms.

Outside of work and study, I am an avid maker, rock climber, soccer player, and reader. I feel like everyone has something they collect; I collect mugs and sci-fi books!
