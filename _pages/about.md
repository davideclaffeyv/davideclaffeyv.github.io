title: "Hello!"
---

I'm David Claffey, a maker, engineer, and student at Georgia Tech. I study Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science, and will soon be pursuing a masters in Computing Intelligence. I'm a manufacturing and machine learning researcher, and I regularly pursue personal projects in robotics, physics, and electronics. I'm a volunteer as a [CNC]({{ site.baseurl }}/CNC/cnc) master and Prototyping Instructor at [Flowers Invention Studio](https://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/).

Feel free to ask me about magnetics, additive manufacturing ideas, cool heat transfer techniques, or sci-fi!

In my free time, I read sci fi, play soccer, lift weights, snowboard (when I can find snow), do CNC and mechatronics projects, and rock climb. I am also currently working on a couple startups... more coming soon!
