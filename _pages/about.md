Hello! I study Mechanical Engineering, AI, and a lot in between. I love research, and participate in several really cool labs at Georgia Tech. Controls, machine learning and autonomy, metallurgical and polymer additive manufacturing, and applied physics are all fields I reguarly engage in. In my free time, I am also a metal CNC master at Flowers Invention Studio.

Check out the exciting places I've worked, projects I've completed or currently am working on, and some miscellaneous info like a list of cool books and an image gallery!

Outside of work and study, I am an avid rock climber, soccer player, reader, coffee snob, and cook.
