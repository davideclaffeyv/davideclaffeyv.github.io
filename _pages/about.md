### Hello

I'm David Claffey, a maker, engineer, and student at Georgia Tech. I currently study Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science Intelligence, and will be pursuing a masters in Computing Intelligence in 2025. I conduct research with several labs and engage in personal projects exploring controls, machine learning, metallurgical / polymer additive manufacturing, and applied physics. I'm a volunteer as a [CNC]({{ site.baseurl }}/CNC/cnc) master and Prototyping Instructor at [Flowers Invention Studio](https://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/). Feel free to ask me about magnetic scanning theory, creative additive manufacturing ideas, cool heat transfer techniques, or sci-fi!

Check out the various pages linked at the top to read more about my personal projects, research experience, and work terms.

In my free time, I read a lot of sci fi, play soccer, lift weights, snowboard (when I can find snow), rock climb, and try sports for the first time such as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Squash! I am also currently working on a couple startups... more coming soon!
