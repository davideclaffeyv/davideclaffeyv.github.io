### Hello
I'm David Claffey, a maker, engineer, and student at Georgia Tech. I'll be pursuing graduate studies in Machine Learning and Manufacturing in 2024, and I currently study Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science Intelligence at GT. I conduct research with several exciting labs and engage in personal projects exploring controls, machine learning and autonomy, metallurgical / polymer additive manufacturing, and applied physics in order to learn more about these fields. In my free time, I am a [CNC]({{ site.baseurl }}/CNC/cnc) master and Prototyping Instructor at [Flowers Invention Studio](https://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/).

Check out the various pages linked at the top to read more about my personal projects, research experience, and work terms.

Outside of work and study, I am an avid rock climber, soccer player, reader, and beginner luthier.
