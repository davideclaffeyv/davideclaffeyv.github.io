### Hello
I'm David Claffey, a maker, engineer, and student at Georgia Tech. I'll be pursuing graduate studies in Machine Learning and Manufacturing in 2024, and I currently study Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science Intelligence at GT. I conduct research with several exciting labs and engage in personal projects exploring controls, machine learning and autonomy, metallurgical / polymer additive manufacturing, and applied physics in order to learn more about these fields. Additionally, I volunteer as a [CNC]({{ site.baseurl }}/CNC/cnc) master and Prototyping Instructor at [Flowers Invention Studio](https://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/), maintaining several high-end CNC machines, managing tool wear and budget, and designing curricula for trainings.

Check out the various pages linked at the top to read more about my personal projects, research experience, and work terms.

Outside of work and study, I like to rock climb, hike, play soccer, lift, woodwork, and read.
