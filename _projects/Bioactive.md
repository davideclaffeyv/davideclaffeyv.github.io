## Crested Geckos

*Correlophus Ciliatus* was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994. Originally native to an New Caledonia, Crested Geckos have since been one of the most widely bred gecko species in herpetology and reptile hobbyists. I take care of two of these beautiful animals, 'Desi', a male, and 'Hazel', a female. Crested Geckos require some specialized care, but their affinity for room temperature environments and lack of necessity for live food is advantageous for a beginner herpetologist.

While just fine surviving in an artificial terrarium, I sought to build a more enriching environment for these geckos including live gecko-safe plants, isopods and springtails for janitorial services, heating and passive drainage to maintain correct humidity and temperature.
