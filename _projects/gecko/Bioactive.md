## Crested Geckos

**Correlophus Ciliatus** was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994. Originally native to an New Caledonia, Crested Geckos have since been one of the most widely bred gecko species in herpetology and reptile hobbyists. I take care of two of these beautiful animals, 'Desi', a male, and 'Hazel', a female. Crested Geckos require some specialized care, but their affinity for room temperature environments and lack of necessity for live food is advantageous for a beginner herpetologist.

While just fine surviving in an artificial terrarium, I sought to build a more enriching environment for these geckos including live gecko-safe plants, isopods and springtails for janitorial services, heating and passive drainage to maintain correct humidity and temperature.

## Spray Foam

Spray foam provided a pet and plant safe carvable backdrop onto which I siliconed dirt, moss, and other aestethics. The process of spray foaming took around 6 hours total, during which I laid out the wood structures for the backdrop, sprayed these in place, and filled in the rest of the back. I tried to build up foam where I expected to carve larger elements. The carving took as much time as I wanted to perfect the shape and structure, but it was more important ot carve a thin layer off of every surface to give the silcone a porous surface to adhere to.

## Drainage

With any bioactive set up, sitting water is going to wreck havoc on certain kinds of biological life by being a great breeding ground for other life (it all depends on your perspective I guess). I did not intend for mold to be a large part of my ecosystem, as this can be dangerous for geckos to breathe, as well as high moisture content allowing a disease called "foot rot". I used leca balls as the lower drainage layer, a sheet of garden weed tarp to separate soil from leca, and finally a mixture of coco fiber, spaghnum moss, and pasturized planting soil. I also pasturized my own magnolia leaves to give the insects some initial meals before the gecko entered the terrarium.

## Planting

There are many resources online for finding gecko safe plants. Even though crested geckos will not ingest the plant life on purpose, isopods definitely will. While I hope Hazel decides to not eat my expensive isopods, I do want to make sure if she decides to that the isopods contain no hazardous materials.

## Final Product

I gave the tank 4 weeks for the plants to set root and the isopods and spring tails to develop healthy populations before introducing Hazel. I have noticed some perculiarities while observing the ecosystem; the isopods prefer to stay in the leca layer, possibly due to a large predator above ground. After a year I thought Hazel had eaten all the isopods and the springtails were all that remained, however I found several infantile isopods near the edges of the leca layer which gives me hope there is a secret underground society. Additionally, the fox fern and small vining plants did not survive. This is most likely due to the humidity of the tank, as the more tropical plants did very well.

Summer of 2024 I plan to construct a cabinet style set of 3 terrariums for the geckos me and my siblings take care of. This terrarium will build on what I learned from Hazel's tank, including automatic misting from a refillable conditioned water tank in the bottom of the cabinet, planting lights, a better drainage system, and natural wood backing that I plan to CNC.
