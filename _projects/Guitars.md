## Introduction

I helped a close friend of mine at Georgia Tech's Invention Studio continue a lifelong hobby of his making custom guitars. Koji and I made seven guitar bodies over the course of 2 months. The CNC operation took 3 hours when we started and we had optimized the tool paths to 40 minutes a guitar by the end of the semester. Seeing Koji finish his guitars, and Georgia Tech post a blurb celebrating his incredible craftsmanship, I decided I'd like to start learning guitar and even build one as well.

## Project Description

An exotic woods shop five minutes down the street from the invention studio has been the primary source of my wooden guitars. When building electric guitars, body shape, electronics, the neck, and materials are all important considerations. I've stuck to tone woods for all of my guitars; woods that are good at holding a guitar's struck tone. More formally, hardness, density, and grain structure of a wood determine the speed of sound through its body. Tone woods are woods that resonate at frequencies close to the guitar's frequencies, multipliers of the harmonics along the string. Alder, maple, mahogany, and rosewood are all common tone woods.

I've CNC'd the bodies of all of my guitars. I CNC the bulk shape, as I have enjoyed hand carving the curves exactly how I'd like them. The common curves on a guitar body include the back cavity where the player's hip sits and aesthetic curves around the neck of the guitar, arms, and base. I found all of my bodies online as cheap dxf files, and ordered necks and electronics from online stores.

For the first walnut guitar, I simply needed something to start playing on. Therefore, I found the cheapest option was to purchase a well used guitar on facebook marketplace and restore the electronics before installing into the body I had made. I resoldered connections, swapped the pick guard, refinished the neck, and installed everything into the body.

All of my guitars have begun with a glue-up/lamination of the base tonewood and my top veneer. The veneers have been .25" to .5" thick, so maybe not appropriate to call them veneers. I've used alder and white limba as my base tone woods, and walnut, quilted maple, and ziricote as my caps.

The next two guitars will use higher quality necks from Warmoth Custom Guitars and Seymore Duncan humbuckers. This summer I want to build the jigs to machine custom necks, and hand-wind my pickups/humbuckers. Everything else was ordered individually: potentiometers, blade switches, and power jacks.

To this day I haven't played an electric guitar I didn't build! I highly recommend Carlton's Exotic Woods and Veneers in Atlanta as well as Atlanta Fine Woods and Warmoth Guitars.
