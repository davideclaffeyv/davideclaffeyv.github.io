## Introduction

This year long project was part of Grand Challenges at Georgia Tech. Inspired by mitigating oceanic plastic pollution, this project explored ways in which plastic could be reused as cost effective materials. The primary material explored and tested was as insulation for developing countries in which pollution is worse due to skeletal waste management systems. To be implemented in tandem with emergent cost-effective AC units.

## Project Description

Several initial applications of plastic pollution were explored such as plastic doped asphault, concrete, build structures, and more.


Our team finally developed insulation that reused plastic pollution for small economy communities, the communities most impact by plastic pollution. Through two semesters of research and prototyping, we explored where in the market we could introduce an economically and environmentally friendly way of reducing plastic pollution in developing countries where waste management systems are under supported. Similar to plastic being used in asphalt, we tested the insulative properties of shredded plastic in a simulated dry wall using laser cutting. Our team wrote several Medium Papers detailing our process and at the end of the year pitched the idea to a panel of professors and researchers.
